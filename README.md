## *Installation Guide*

****
- **1:** Install Jupyter Labs and run it from the terminal. Make sure that you make sure you have an up-to-date version of Python
 [Install and run JupyterLab:](https://jupyter.org/install)
- **2:** Copy URL of this repo
- **3:** Clone folder to this repo and open in jupyter labs
- **4:** Ensure that you have the imports correctly identified to download

---

## *Usage*

**Jupyter Lab**
- Running the code can be done in one of two ways:
    1. You can click the "play" button at the very top of the notebook.
    2. You can click shift + enter on each block of code to run each batch of code as you go through it.

## *Final Product*

The model utilizes 116 inputs to train the model. We have attempted to manipulate 3 different variables to optimize the training. 
Model 1: Layer 1 hidden nodes - 58, renu activation, Layer 2 hidden nodes - 29, renu activation, sigmoid output layer activation 
Model 2: Layer 1 hidden nodes - 78, renu activation, Layer 2 hidden nodes - 39, renu activation, sigmoid output layer activation 
Model 3: Layer 1 hidden nodes - 78, sigmoid activation, Layer 2 hidden nodes - 39, sigmoid activation, sigmoid output layer activation 

You can models one and two manipulate the number of hidden nodes and model 3 manipulated the activation. None of these variables had a big effect on the results of roughly 74% accuracy and 53% loss. The accuracy seems good and better than the 50-50 success rate but I am concerned about the loss rate of 53%
